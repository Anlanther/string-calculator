# Calculator Project Practice

This project was created to practice the use of fixed lists, basic Java syntax and method creation, as well as test driven development principles using JUnit. 

It consists of just the calculator class that takes an equation in string form with its `evaulate()` method and returns an answer as a one decimal point double. It follows mathematic rules in terms of which operations to do first (/, *, +, -).

## Project Rules & Limitations
- Brackets and exponents are not allowed in the equation passed
- When a number is divided by zero, the calculator will return `0.0` and a message: `Answer is undefined`
- ArrayLists are not allowed. Only fixed lists with predetermined lengths can be used
